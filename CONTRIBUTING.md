I'm happy to accept pull requests and issue reports

Please note that CGI.pm is now considered done. See also "mature" and "legacy".
Feature requests and none critical issues will probably be rejected, although
pull requests will be accepted if they are small in scope and included tests
and perldoc. So if you want a shiny new feature you're going to have to add it
yourself and submit a pull request.

The one exception to accepting pull requests is for any HTML functionality in
the module - these methods are considered deprecated. There will be no changes
to them or pull requests accepted for them no matter how trivial.

When sending bug reports please provide the version of CGI.pm, the version of
perl, the name and version of your Web server, and the name and version of the
operating system you are using. If the problem is even remotely browser
dependent, please provide information about the affected browsers as well.

You are strongly advised to update to the latest version of the module and
test your issue with it before submitting a report. Failing tests cases are
appreciated with issues, please see the existing tests in t/ for examples.
