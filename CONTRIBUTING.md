I'm happy to accept pull requests and issue reports

Please note that CGI.pm is now considered done. See also "mature" and "legacy".
Feature requests and non-critical issues will probably be rejected.

When sending bug reports please provide the version of CGI.pm, the version of
perl, the name and version of your Web server, and the name and version of the
operating system you are using. If the problem is even remotely browser
dependent, please provide information about the affected browsers as well.

You are strongly advised to update to the latest version of the module and
test your issue with it before submitting a report. Failing tests cases are
appreciated with issues, please see the existing tests in t/ for examples.

Please note that github issues isn't the place for help getting scripts
working. This is for bug reports and pull requests. I would first suggest
looking at the [examples](https://metacpan.org/source/LEEJO/CGI-4.21/examples)
in the distribution, reading the [docs](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/CGI/lib/CGI.pod),
and then asking at [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or
[perlmonks](http://www.perlmonks.org/).
